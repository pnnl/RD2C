# PNNL Edge Computing
This Repo houses the code for potential Edge Computing algorithms that can be
implemented by PNNL. The current code constructs a Decentralized Federated
Learning Setting. We will utilize this framework to solve robust optimization
problems.

## Federated Parametric DRO

The main goal of this repo is to construct a distributed algorithm which can
train a DRO model. This DRO model will be parameterized by a neural network.
